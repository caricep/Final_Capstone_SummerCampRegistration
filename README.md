# Final Capstone - Summer Camp Registration
Full Stack Application developed over a 2-week period, on an Agile team using Java, SQL, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML and CSS.

Description: A summer camp currently uses spreadsheets to process registrations for attendees of the camp. Attendees enter their registrations in an online form builder application, which generates the CSV files they work with. Currently, users use spreadsheets with the attendees to verify, correct and update information. For security purposes, users are not able to edit the database directly, so they keep 2 sets of records, log which records need to be updated, and then update them in the original data manually.
The proposed application would load a CSV and allows users to update the information, tracking which information needs to be manually updated in the original data source.
